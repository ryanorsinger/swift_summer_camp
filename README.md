WEEK ONE
Day 1 Monday
Morning Session:
Objectives:
    - Introductions
    - Break the ice (a couple of times)
    - Set ground rules and expectations
    - Setup dev environment
    - Start intro exercises in XCode playground

Welcome & Introductions
    Name, school, why here, interesting facts

Additional Icebreaker = Brain teaser (with a lead-in at the end)
    - Imaginee that you want to introduce yourself to every other individual in the classroom.
    - What is the total sum of all the 1:1 introductions for every human in the room?
    - Give them time to figure it out. Invite students to reason about it aloud and together.
    - Answer is N^2... but why is this useful?

This is the power of a network. The power of distributed computing and the value of the internet itself is also a square of the number of users/computers.
- You are all now part of eachother's personal network. Even after this summer camp is over, you will still be part of eachother's network.

Ground Rules
    - Be respectful of eachother.
    - No "isms".
        - No sexism,no racism, no any-isms!
        - All of us, together, we will not tolorate intolorance. We are prejudiced against prejudice.
        - Creating a safe environment is the responsibility of every individual in the group.
    - Potential icebreaker
        - Get each student to stand up, state their name, and make a pledge to the group that they won't abide any isms.
        - "My name is ____. I pledge that I will not accept or promote predjudice in any way."
            (or something similar)
    - Have an attitude, a persistently positive one!

Attitude:
- Attitude and emotions are contageous! Aah-choo!
- "Easy" learning is not always the most durable and dependable.
- Often, "difficult" learning where progress feels slowest and confusion the highest is the time when the most connections are being made.
- We're all in this together.
- Know the power of "yet". Whenever you hear someone say something like "My function isn't working" or "I don't understand this", jump in and say "YET!" with a big huge smile!

What you will DO:
- Build 3 games in the Swift language using XCode and SpriteKit. Tetris, Space Invaders, and Flappy Bird.
- Learn and apply programming fundamentals that relate to all programming languages.
- Develop your working familiarity with the Swift language, XCode IDE, iOS SDK, and SpriteKit

Expect and be ready to:
- Learn lots of new words and their definitions. Programming, like all disciplines, has its own language. And language affords its users the power of precision.
- Ask lots of questions!
- Research lots of questions!
- Collaborate! Work with your fellow classmates, help your classmates, and seek assistance from those who already understand something that you don't yet.
- Make tons of mistakes. Mistakes are a golden path to learning things in a very solid and durable way.
- See and experience lots of error messages.

How to get the most value from the class:
- Get to know your classmates
- Have fun!
- Ask specific questions. "My code is broken" is not a question. It's a statement. Also, that's like going to a mechanic's camp and saying "my car is broken".
- Write a lot of code
- Read a lot of code

Core Competencies in Software Development:
- Reading and writing
- Attention to detail
- Spotting differences
- Planning and debugging - break big problems into smaller problems

What does it take to be a coder?
- Read code
- Write code

Another Icebreaker = Poll the student body for familiarity with programming concepts and experience

Let's get started:

Setup is simple. Let's make sure you get these things done.
    Update Mac OS X to Yosimite
    Install/Update XCode 6

80/20 rule = Pareto
What's the 20% of Swift that you'll use almost all the time?

Background
Tools and Material needed
What is Swift?
“Swift is Apple's latest programming language. In time it will replace Objective-C as the primary language in which iPhone and Macintosh applications are written.”
What is Xcode?
“Xcode is an integrated development environment (IDE) containing a suite of software development tools developed by Apple for developing software for OS X and iOS.”
What is SpriteKit?
“SpriteKit is a set of APIs provided by the iOS SDK (software development kit) which allow native 2D game development from within Xcode.

Familiarizing with XCode
