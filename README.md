Why are we here?

What you will DO:
- Build 3 games in the Swift language using XCode and SpriteKit.
- Learn and apply programming fundamentals that relate to all programming languages.
- Develop your working familiarity with the Swift language, XCode IDE, iOS SDK, and SpriteKit

Expect and be ready to:
- Learn lots of new words and their definitions. Programming, like all disciplines, has its own language.
- Collaborate! Work with your fellow classmates, help your classmates, and seek assistance from those who already understand something that you don't yet.
- Make tons of mistakes. Mistakes are a golden path to learning things in a very solid and durable way.
- See and experience lots of error messages.

How to get the most value from the class:
- Ask specific questions
- Have fun!
- Write a lot of code
- Read a lot of code
- Make mistakes
- Ask questions

Core Competencies in Software Development:
- Reading and writing
- Attention to detail
- Spotting differences
- Planning and debugging

What does it take to be a coder?
- Read code
- Write code

Attitude:
- Attitude and emotions are contageous! Aah-choo!
- "Easy" learning is not always the most durable and dependable.
- We're all in this together.
- The power of "yet".

Let's get started:

Setup is simple.
    Update Mac OS X to Yosimite
    Install/Update XCode 6

80/20 rule
